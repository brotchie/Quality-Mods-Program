# Starmap Buffs

**Pin Star With Shift Click:** Hold shift while clicking a star in the star map to pin it. Pinned stars will show a "(Pinned)" suffix after their name in the star detail view.
**Show Star Details On Hover:** Mouse over a star in the star map to view its details. This makes it really easy to scan stars for available resources rather than clicking and then scrolling out.

## How to use

Open up the starmap (Hotkey: `V`) and hover over a star to see it's details. Hold shift while clicking on a star to pin it.
